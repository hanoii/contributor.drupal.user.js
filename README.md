# contributor.drupal.user.js

I normally like to see how the modules I contributed are being used as well as quickly identify those I created and those I am listed as a maintainer.

This was just a playground for userscripts.

I tested this with https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey on Chrome.
