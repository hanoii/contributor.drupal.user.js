# contributor.drupal.user.js

I normally like to see how the modules I contributed are being used as well as quickly identify those I created and those I am listed as a maintainer.

This was just a playground for userscripts.

I tested this with https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey on Chrome.

- Green are the ones you created.
- Yellow are the ones you are listed as a maintainer.

It is supposed to work only on your profile page when logged in and it has some localStorage cache not to query the projects every time, but rather weekly.
